# Header

This is the header. It's part of the layout component that renders each page.

The router is provided by `NextJS` with `useRouter` but we are passing it here declaratively to show you the active route styles.

<Playground>
  <Header router={{ pathname: "/awesome" }} logo={"./public/computer.svg"} />
</Playground>
